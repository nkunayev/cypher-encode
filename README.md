Ciphers Program

This C++ program provides encryption and decryption using two popular cipher techniques: Caesar Cipher and Vigenère Cipher. It also includes functionality for automated decryption of Caesar Cipher using a dictionary-based approach to find potential valid plaintext.

Features

Caesar Cipher Encryption: Rotate each letter in a text by a specified number of positions.
Caesar Cipher Decryption: Attempt to decrypt a Caesar Cipher by testing all possible rotations and comparing against a dictionary.
Vigenère Cipher Encryption: Encrypt text using a keyword to apply a sequence of Caesar shifts.
Dictionary Check: The program uses a dictionary file (dictionary.txt) to validate words for automatic Caesar Cipher decryption.

Input Format

For Caesar Cipher, provide the text and the number of rotations.
For Vigenère Cipher, provide the text and a keyword for encryption.
For Decryption, the program will attempt to decrypt Caesar Cipher text by testing all 26 shifts and comparing words against the dictionary.
